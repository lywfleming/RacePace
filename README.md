## Presentation for [Shiny App Race Pace Calculator](https://lywfleming.shinyapps.io/Assignment/)
### Created to fulfill requirements for Coursera Developing Data Products class run by Johns Hopkins

The Race Pace Shiny App Calculator was developed to aid distance runners in calculating their optimal pace to be successful in a variety 
of race lengths.

The race pace calculator:

* Calculates an individual's race pace based on their recorded time for a one mile time trial

* Based on Jeff Galloway's Magic Mile Race Formulas[1] he derived after working with data from 170,000 runners and compiling their race times.

* Calculations are not very accurate for faster time trial times around 4-5 minutes. The resulting pace for a 10K is faster than that for a 5K.

* Main drawback is that a one mile time trial can be run more anaerobically, whereas distance races are strictly aerobic.
